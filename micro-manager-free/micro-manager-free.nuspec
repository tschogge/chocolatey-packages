    <summary>Micromanager only lets you use whitelisted apps you need to do work, while blocking
      everything else.</summary>
    <description>Micromanager locks your attention into applications you selected in your whitelist.
      Any other application you try to open will be minimized or closed until your block is over.
      Your productivity suffers when you try to split your attention over multiple tasks. There's
      even science to back this up. </description>
