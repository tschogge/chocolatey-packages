This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.nuget.org/create/Nuspec-Reference. Chocolatey
uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such
there are certain things to be aware of:

* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl,
mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring
tools or commands will error on those elements
-->

<!-- You can embed software files directly into packages, as long as you are not bound by
distribution rights. -->
<!-- * If you are an organization making private packages, you probably have no issues here -->
<!-- * If you are releasing to the community feed, you need to consider distribution rights. -->
<!-- Do not remove this test for UTF-8: if “Ω” doesn’t appear as greek uppercase omega letter
enclosed in quotation marks, you should use an editor that supports UTF-8, not this one. -->

    <summary>The beta version of Threema 2.0 for desktop allows users to already use the upcoming
      multi-device functionality with a mobile device and up to two computers.</summary>
    <description>Version 2.0 of Threema’s desktop app is a major update that will not only introduce
      a completely redesigned user interface, but it will also be based on a totally new
      architecture. Thanks to multi-device functionality, this version of the desktop app no longer
      requires an active connection to the mobile device.

      The beta version of Threema 2.0 for desktop allows users to already use the upcoming
      multi-device functionality with a mobile device and up to two computers. Users can connect the
      mobile Threema app (version 6.0 for Android and version 6.4 for iOS and above) with the beta
      version of Threema 2.0 installed on a computer and use them independently from each other.
      (The regular desktop app can still be used alongside the beta version.)</description>
