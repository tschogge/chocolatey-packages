    <summary>The beta version of Threema 2.0 for desktop allows users to already use the upcoming
      multi-device functionality with a mobile device and up to two computers.</summary>
    <description>Version 2.0 of Threema’s desktop app is a major update that will not only introduce
      a completely redesigned user interface, but it will also be based on a totally new
      architecture. Thanks to multi-device functionality, this version of the desktop app no longer
      requires an active connection to the mobile device.

      The beta version of Threema 2.0 for desktop allows users to already use the upcoming
      multi-device functionality with a mobile device and up to two computers. Users can connect the
      mobile Threema app (version 6.0 for Android and version 6.4 for iOS and above) with the beta
      version of Threema 2.0 installed on a computer and use them independently from each other.
      (The regular desktop app can still be used alongside the beta version.)</description>
